Welcome! This is the official page of the unofficial UCSD Race Condition Running
Club. We welcome runners of all types. Feel free to join us on any of our
workout days. Easy days are the best for newcomers or beginners ðŸ˜„

The workouts we post can always be tailored to your experience level. Some
people will run farther or faster than others. So, don't feel intimidated - we
will help guide you to something that matches your ability.

Some of us are more serious about running than others, but the central goal of
this club is to show people, especially graduate students, that running is an
enjoyable activity which has many health benefits and can be lots of fun
(trust us)!! You can make it as easy or difficult as you like.

You can find all the most up-to-date info about the club below:
